Just wanted to post a few thoughts from 2023; some things I've learned about myself and realized.

The biggest news of the year was adding a daughter to our family. My wife unexpectedly delivered
her in our first daughters bedroom. On top of a wild story, everyone was and is healthy and happy.

One of the things that came along with adding another human to our family was the additional time
and energy needed to be a parent. It's been a long time coming, but this year really forced me to
understand myself, and dig deeper into things I've taken for granted. For most of my adult life
I've unknowingly had sufficient money and extra time on my hands. Again, it's a privilege for
several reasons and I never realized it until the existence of free time basically evaporated.
This is one of the things I learned about myself.

Fortuantely I have a wife that challenges me to better understand myself. Also I have a therapist
that I've had a relationship with since before the birth of our first child giving me an outlet
to help recognize things I wasn't able to see myself. My therapist helped me to see that in the
past I was trading time for, really, whatever I needed at the time; having fun, learning something
I needed to learn for work, _doing_ work, whatever. Now I'm at a place in my life where I
essentially have little to no time for trading.

During this time I was listening to an episode of the Linux Unplugged podcast where the topic of
ADHD came up, and several listeners had written into the show. The host, Chris, talked about his
diagnosis of ADHD as a teenager and his journey afterward. While listening to some of these
conversation I started to notice some parallels with my life. I can't remember if a listener
had written in with details that were similar to what I was feeling or what it was specifically.
During my next session I asked my therapist if she thought I may have ADHD.

Long story short, after a referral for a full nero-psychological evaluation I did receive an
ADHD diagnosis. My therapist and the psychologist that diagnosed me both agreed that I've
probably been ADHD my entire life, but I had sufficient levers to pull to cope. However,
my therapist succinclty stated I had "reached the edge of my cope."
