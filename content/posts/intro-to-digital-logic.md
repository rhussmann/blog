Have you ever wanted to know how computers work? Not the software; the Facebooks or the Googles, but the hardware. The bits of copper and silicon and electricity. How can we plug a box into the wall (or have it run off a battery) that literally has no moving parts outside of a fan and make it produce images, or calculate numbers, or visit dating sites, or transmit pictures of your grandchildren fully around the world or even to space? How do these things **do** that?

This is the first of series of blog posts to help answer some of the fundamental questions. Of the course of these posts, we're going to explore the building-blocks of how computers work. We'll start with digital logic gates (don't worry, digital logic gates will be explained later) and learn about each gate's behavior, and how they can be combined to build larger building-blocks. We'll use these building blocks to explain some electronic devices. Ultimately, we'll build and design a CPU that executes a set of CPU instructions that we will implement.

At the end of this series, you'll have foundational understanding of how not only computers work, but also electrical components that exist outside of computers as well like timers, IoT devices, microcontrollers; all kinds of electronic devices.
